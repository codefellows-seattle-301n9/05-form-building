# Project Name

**Author**: Cody Green
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
As a user, I want to be able to add new articles to my blog app so that it can stay current over time.

Review the image preview.png in the lab directory to get an idea of what we will be building.
Focus on the functionality of adding a new article through a form submission by completing the TODOs in articleView.js.
The new page with the form should provide a JSON string which can be copy/pasted into the data file to add articles to the blog.
As a developer, I want to make the user experience easy to understand so that the user will want to return to the blog.

We now have two pages in our blog app, each of which need different initialization. There is a skeleton of a method in articleView.js to get this started for the new page; be sure to examine how this is now being done for the index page.
The new page with the form will need event handling and a template. Where should these pieces go in the code?
The new page should not display any other articles; how to manage this?
## Getting Started
