# Lab-05-form-building

**Author**: Brandon Buchholz
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This app uses a form that can be filled out for new blog articles. We used JSON on the new page with the form and provided a JSON string which can be copy/pasted into the data file to add articles to the blog.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
  1. First, I started on cloning down the repo to my local machine.
  2. Next, we as a class went through the TODO's and comments setting up a plan of what we wanted to work on first.
  3. Next, I worked on completing the TODO's and comments.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used a CDN for our jQuery library and linked it in at the bottom of our HTML. Also used a normailze.css file linked into our HTML at the top of our CSS links so that we start with a consistent browser rendering. We also used Handlebars.js to help with settign up a template for the articles.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:-->
