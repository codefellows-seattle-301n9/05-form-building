# 05-form-building

**Author**: Arthur Allen
**Version**: 1.0.2 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
To create a form to submit blog articles in the proper format for displaying in the Kilovolt Blog.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
HTML, JavaScript, CSS and JSON

## Change Log
Last week I swore I would set up the README and log all changes from the start, but I forgot.

Over the week I tried to plug in the lecture and code review code, still missing some bits and pieces.

On Thursday December 14, we quad-coded this, with my Lab 6 partner and another pair of students.  I finally got new.html to output some JSON.  When that was put into blogArticles.js, it broke the code, so I had a specific question to give the TA on Saturday.

On that day, we soon figured out that we needed a comma after what was pasted, and then it didn't break the code.  We gradually debugged the code until it worked.

## Credits and Collaborations
Maddy the TA helped, as did my Lab 6 pair partner Raphael.
