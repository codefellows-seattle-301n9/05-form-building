## Lab-05: Form Building

**Author**: Chris Lesesne
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application allows users to create new article blogs to add and post to the main page of the site.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
A form with the proper text input elements must be built to take in information for a newly create article. Methods must be written to create a new instance of an article object with changes to the article information being displayed in real time.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This application was designed and built with jQuery, Handlebars.js, highlight.js library, and marked.js Markdown rendering library.
